<div id="text">The Game Marvel's Spider-Man is an action-adventure developed by Insominci Games and published by Sony Interaction Entertainment for the Playstation 4, based on the Marvel comic superhero Spider-Man. Released worldwide on September 7, 2018, it is the first licensed game developed by Insomniac. The game tells a new story about Spider-Man that is not tied to an existing comic book, video game, or film, and covers both the Peter Parker and Spider-Man aspects of the character.
  <p>Spider-Man was well received upon release. Critics called it one of the best superhero games made, praising its gameplay, particularly the combat and web-swinging mechanics, graphics, narrative, characterization, and design of New York City, though felt it lacked innovation in its open-world design. The game became a commercial success, selling 3.3 million copies in its first three days of release, and broke several sales records.</p>
